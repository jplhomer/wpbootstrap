WP BOOTSTRAP
===================

Twitter's bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) in Wordpress theme form. Using Eddie Machado's Bones for a starting point (https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) as well as 320Press' original theme (https://github.com/320press/wordpress-bootstrap). 

## FEATURES

It's a Bootstrap-flavored Wordpress theme. It could be used as-is or as a starting point for theme developers. It’s built on top of the Bones theme framework by Eddie Machado, based on 320Press' original theme, and based on v2.0 of Twitter’s Bootstrap.

This project is still in development. I've done a few things that I hope will make your WP Bootstrappin' experience a joy.

### Responsive

Per Twitter Bootstrap 2.0, this theme is built with a responsive approach.  This will look good on everything from mobile to desktop.

### Page Templates

There are three different page templates in this theme:
* Hero Homepage template (seen on the homepage of this site)
* Standard page with right sidebar
* Full width page

### Theme Options Panel

Want to change some colors? Want the top nav to scroll with the content? Emphasize the first paragraph? Change the typography? Do it all and more in the options panel.

### Shortcodes

Shortcodes are built to best use the Twitter Bootstrap features:

* Buttons
* Alerts
* Progress Bars

### Bootstrap Components

If you'd like to use Twitter Bootstrap components like ScrollSpy, Navtabs, Navpills, or Accordion, I've built that in, too! Choose this feature when adding or editing a page.

### Sidebars

There is one main sidebar, three footer sidebars, and a Hero homepage featurettes list.
